 - simple simd abstraction layer -

Compile by defining your compiler COMPILER_GCC or COMPILER_MSVC
and your instruction set: SIMD_NONE, SIMD_ALTIVEC, SIMD_SPU or SIMD_SEE.
For SSE, define SIMD_SSE to be the instruction set version you want to
compile for (SIMD_SSE=3).

This library is work in progress, any feedback and patches are welcome.
